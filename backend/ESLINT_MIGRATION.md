# ESLint 9 Migration Notes

ESLint has been upgraded to v9. If you encounter any issues, you may need to migrate the ESLint config.

ESLint 9 uses a new flat config format. The current `.eslintrc.js` should still work, but if you see errors, consider migrating to the new format.

For now, the existing config should work fine with ESLint 9.
